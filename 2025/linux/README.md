# Week 2: Linux System Administration & Automation

Welcome to **Week 2** of the **90 Days of DevOps - 2025 Edition**! This week, we dive into **Linux system administration and automation**, covering essential topics such as **user management, file permissions, log analysis, process control, volume mounts, and shell scripting**.

---

## üöÄ Project: DevOps Linux Server Monitoring & Automation
Imagine you're managing a **Linux-based production server** and need to ensure that **users, logs, and processes** are well-managed. You will perform real-world tasks such as **log analysis, volume management, and automation** to enhance your DevOps skills.

## üìå Tasks

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ User & Group Management**
- Learn about Linux **users, groups, and permissions** (`/etc/passwd`, `/etc/group`).

Answer : 

- Users: A user in Linux is an account that can log in and interact with the system.Each user has a unique username and a User ID (UID).Users can own files and run programs.

- Groups: A group is a collection of users.Groups make it easier to manage permissions for multiple users at once.Each group has a unique Group Name and a Group ID (GID).A user can belong to one primary group and multiple secondary groups.

- Permissions: Permissions control what users and groups can do with files and directories. Every file and directory has three types of permissions:

   - 1.Read (r): View the contents of a file or list files in a directory.

   - 2.Write (w): Modify a file or add/remove files in a directory.

   - 3.Execute (x): Run a file as a program or enter a directory.

- **Task:**  
  - Create a user `devops_user` and add them to a group `devops_team`.
  - Set a password and grant **sudo** access.
  - Restrict SSH login for certain users in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`.

- Restrict SSH login for specific users (in /etc/ssh/sshd_config):

Edit the file: sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Add the following line to restrict access:
      DenyUsers user1 user2 user3

** Explanation: **

- DenyUsers: Specifies a list of usernames that are explicitly denied SSH access.
      Restart the SSH service to apply changes:
      sudo systemctl restart sshd

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ File & Directory Permissions**
- **Task:**  
  - Create `/devops_workspace` and a file `project_notes.txt`.
  
  Solution:

  - Set permissions:
    - **Owner can edit**, **group can read**, **others have no access**.
  - Use `ls -l` to verify permissions.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Log File Analysis with AWK, Grep & Sed**
Logs are crucial in DevOps! You‚Äôll analyze logs using the **Linux_2k.log** file from **LogHub** ([GitHub Repo](https://github.com/logpai/loghub/blob/master/Linux/Linux_2k.log)).

- **Task:**  
    - **Download the log file** from the repository.
    - **Extract insights using commands:**
    - Use `grep` to find all occurrences of the word **"error"**.
Solution:
<image src = "https://github.com/ayushgurjar185/90DaysOfDevOps/blob/9d7fd56722a538c3b657777358bc8bfa16520615/2025/Images/LinuxImg/grep.PNG">

   - Use `awk` to extract **timestamps and log levels**.
Solution :

   - Use `sed` to replace all IP addresses with **[REDACTED]** for security.
Solution :

   - **Bonus:** Find the most frequent log entry using `awk` or `sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -10`.

  - Use `ps`, `top`, and `htop` to monitor it.
  - Kill the process and verify it's gone.
